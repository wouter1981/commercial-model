# Pact standalone executables

This package contains the Ruby implementations of the Pact Mock Service, Pact Provider Verifier and Pact Broker Client, packaged with Travelling Ruby so that they can be run from the command line without a Ruby installation.

To connect to a Pact Broker that uses custom SSL cerificates, set the environment variable `$SSL_CERT_FILE` or `$SSL_CERT_DIR` to a path that contains the appropriate certificate.

Description:
  Start a stub service with the given pact file(s) or directories. Pact URIs may be
  local file or directory paths, or HTTP. Include any basic auth details in the
  URL using the format https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URI. Where multiple matching
  interactions are found, the interactions will be sorted by response status,
  and the first one will be returned. This may lead to some non-deterministic
  behaviour. If you are having problems with this, please raise it on the
  pact-dev google group, and we can discuss some potential enhancements. Note
  that only versions 1 and 2 of the pact specification are currently fully
  supported. Pacts using the v3 format may be used, however, any matching
  features added in v3 will currently be ignored.

Description:
  Returns exit code 0 or 1, indicating whether or not the specified application
  (pacticipant) versions are compatible (ie. safe to deploy). Prints out the
  relevant pact/verification details, indicating any missing or failed
  verification results.

  The environment variables PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL, PACT_BROKER_USERNAME and
  PACT_BROKER_PASSWORD may be used instead of their respective command line
  options.

  There are two ways to use `can-i-deploy`. The first (recommended and most commonly
  used) approach is to specify just the application version you want to deploy
  and let the Pact Broker work out the dependencies for you. The second
  approach is to specify each application version explicitly. This would
  generally only be used if there were limitations that stopped you being able
  to use the first approach.

  #### Specifying an application version

  To specify an application (pacticipant) version you need to provide:

  * the name of the application using the `--pacticipant PACTICIPANT` parameter,
  * directly followed by *one* of the following parameters: * `--version
  VERSION` to specify a known application version (recommended) * `--latest` to
  specify the latest version * `--latest TAG` to specify the latest version
  that has a particular tag * `--all TAG` to specify all the versions that have
  a particular tag (eg. "all prod" versions). This would be used when ensuring
  you have backwards compatiblity with all production mobile clients for a
  provider. Note, when using this option, you need to specify dependency
  explicitly (see the second usage option).

  Using a specific version is the easiest way to ensure you get an accurate response
  that won't be affected by race conditions.

  #### Recommended usage - allowing the Pact Broker to automatically determine the
  dependencies

  Prerequisite: if you would like the Pact Broker to calculate the dependencies for you when
  you want to deploy an application into a given environment, you will need to
  let the Broker know which version of each application is in that environment.
  To do this, the relevant application version resource in the Broker will need
  to be "tagged" with the name of the environment during the deployment
  process:

  $ pact-broker create-version-tag --pacticipant Foo --version 173153ae0 --tag
  test

  This allows you to use the following simple command to find out if you are safe
  to deploy:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --version VERSION \ --to
  ENVIRONMENT \ --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  If the `--to` tag is omitted, then the query will return the compatiblity with
  the overall latest version of each of the other applications.

  Examples:

  Can I deploy version 173153ae0 of application Foo to the test environment?

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Foo --version 173153ae0 \ --to test \
  --broker-base-url https://my-pact-broker

  Can I deploy the latest version of application Foo with the latest version of
  each of the applications it integrates to?

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Foo --latest \ --broker-base-url
  https://my-pact-broker

  Can I deploy the latest version of the application Foo that has the tag "test"
  to the "prod" environment?

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Foo --latest test \ --to prod \
  --broker-base-url https://my-pact-broker

  #### Alternate usage - specifying dependencies explicitly

  If you are unable to use tags, or there is some other limitation that stops you
  from using the recommended approach, you can specify one or more of the
  dependencies explictly. You must also do this if you want to use the `--all
  TAG` option for any of the pacticipants.

  You can specify as many application versions as you like, and you can even
  specify multiple versions of the same application (repeat the `--pacticipant`
  name and supply a different version.)

  You can use explictly declared dependencies with or without the `--to
  ENVIRONMENT`. For example, if you declare two (or more) application versions
  with no `--to ENVIRONMENT`, then only the applications you specify will be
  taken into account when determining if it is safe to deploy. If you declare
  two (or more) application versions _as well as_ a `--to ENVIRONMENT`, then
  the Pact Broker will work out what integrations your declared applications
  will have in that environment when determining if it safe to deploy. When
  using this script for a production release, and you are using tags, it is
  always the most future-proof option to use the `--to` if possible, as it will
  catch any newly added consumers or providers.

  If you are finding that your dependencies are not being automatically included
  when you supply multiple pacticipant versions, please upgrade to the latest
  version of the Pact Broker, as this is a more recently added feature.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT_1 [--version VERSION_1 |
  --latest [TAG_1] | --all TAG_1] \ --pacticipant PACTICIPANT_2 [--version
  VERSION_2 | --latest [TAG_2] | --all TAG_2] \ [--to ENVIRONMENT] \
  --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  Examples:

  Can I deploy version Foo version 173153ae0 and Bar version ac23df1e8 together?

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Foo --version 173153ae0 \
  --pacticipant Bar --version ac23df1e8 \ --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  Can I deploy the latest version of Foo with tag "master" and the latest version
  of Bar with tag "master" together?

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Foo --latest master \ --pacticipant
  Bar --latest master \ --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  Mobile provider use case - can I deploy version b80e7b1b of Bar, all versions of
  Foo with tag "prod", and the latest version tagged "prod" of any other
  automatically calculated dependencies together? (Eg. where Bar is a provider
  and Foo is a mobile consumer with multiple versions in production, and Bar
  also has its own providers it needs to be compatible with.)

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Bar --version b80e7b1b \
  --pacticipant Foo --all prod \ --to prod \ --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL
